# Prompt Engineering & Evaluation Toolkit

This repository contains resources for practicing various prompt engineering techniques and systematically evaluating results using OpenAI's models.

## ðŸš€ Overview

This toolkit demonstrates different prompting strategies and provides utilities to evaluate the quality of responses from large language models like GPT-4. The main components include:

- Implementation of various prompting techniques (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought)
- Evaluation functions to assess response quality
- Red-teaming utilities to test model safety and robustness
- Comparative analysis between different prompt formulations

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
